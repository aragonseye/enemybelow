4 ships, 1 sub. 

sub starts out and only goes in a particular direction unless it hits a boundary, then it turns in 
a random direction and moves that way again until it hits boundary

sub depth is a CONST for the submarine

ships can fire on the sub when within 3 spaces. Sub can return fire. 


ships start at 4 pre-determined starting positions.

Going to need to figure out coding for coordinates on a map - it's going to be a little
diff than the way we do rogue-like plotting
